# Audio Diffusion Model Project

This project focuses on the development and understanding of an audio diffusion model using PyTorch. Audio diffusion models are a type of generative model that learns to generate complex audio signals by gradually denoising a random signal. This README aggregates all the key information, setup instructions, and components needed to work with and explore audio diffusion models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and experiment with a simplified audio diffusion model framework for generating synthetic audio signals. This includes creating a custom dataset, defining the model architecture, computing the loss during training, and synthesizing new audio samples from noise.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- PyTorch
- Librosa
- NumPy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install torch librosa numpy
```

### Dataset

The `MySyntheticAudioDataset` class is designed to generate synthetic sine wave audio signals for training. It's a placeholder for experimenting when specific audio data is not available.

### Model

The `AudioDiffusionModel` provides a conceptual framework for the diffusion model. It outlines the core components and steps for setting up such a model, including initializing the model, setting up a training loop, and computing the loss function.

### Training

The training process involves using the `compute_loss` function to calculate the difference between the model's predictions and the actual data at various stages of the diffusion process. The goal is to train the model to predict the noise added at each timestep and reverse this process to generate clean audio signals.

### Synthesis

The model includes a `sample` method to synthesize new audio signals from random noise by iteratively applying the reverse diffusion process.

## Usage

To use this project for training an audio diffusion model, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Dataset:**

Implement the `MySyntheticAudioDataset` class to provide synthetic or real audio data for training.

2. **Model Setup:**

Initialize the `AudioDiffusionModel` with the desired configuration.

3. **Training Loop:**

Use the `compute_loss` function within a training loop to optimize the model's parameters.

4. **Audio Generation:**

After training, use the model's `sample` method to generate new audio samples from noise.

## Code Structure
